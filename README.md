Code for Janke &amp; Steinke (2020): "Probabilistic multivariate electricity price forecasting using implicit generative ensemble post-processing"
https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13417

IGEP models can be used to generate samples from an implicit multivariate predictive distribution given the predictions of an 
ensemble of point forecasting models.

Run "Main.py" to train the model and create predictions.
